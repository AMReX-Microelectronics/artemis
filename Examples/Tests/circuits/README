For all simulations we use

amr.n_cell = 128 128 128
geometry.prob_lo = -16.e-6 -16.e-6 -16.e-6
geometry.prob_hi =  16.e-6  16.e-6  16.e-6

(dx = 2.5e-7)

The PEC tube walls have normal in the +/- x and z directions, so the direction of propagation is y

inputs_1 - initialize a wave inside the PEC.  pml boundary conditions at all walls

Upcoming: initialize a current source on the lo-y wall
