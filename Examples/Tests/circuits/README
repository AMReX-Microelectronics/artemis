These are pure EM simulations (USE_LLG=FALSE) demonstrating some basic circuit setups.

For all simulations we use:

amr.n_cell = 128 128 128
geometry.prob_lo = -16.e-6 -16.e-6 -16.e-6
geometry.prob_hi =  16.e-6  16.e-6  16.e-6

(dx = 2.5e-7)

The PEC tube walls have normal in the +/- x and z directions, so the direction of propagation is y.

The tube geometry was generated using Excitation_Flag_Generator.py with inputs_exampledata_Excitation_Flag_Generator
as an input (renname it "exampledata_Excitation_Flag_Generator.txt" to re-run it).
We have removed the y-dependence to make the lines shorter to parse, since the walls extend the entire
domain in y.

inputs_wave - initialize a wave inside the PEC tube.  pml boundary conditions at all walls

inputs_current - provide a current source at the lo-y boundary inside the tube

inputs_current_large - provide a current source at the lo-y boundary in a region larger than the tube
                       (and zero the current source inside the tube)

inputs_silicon - same as inputs_2 but with the tube wall with -z normal replaced with silicon
